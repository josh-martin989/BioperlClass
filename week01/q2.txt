I picked vi (vim) to use because this is what I am already most familiar with.
I have been able to do everything I need to in using it for the past couple
years, and it is the quickest way to edit for me. Features such as the syntax
coloring when I am writing code are quite helpful in producing functional
scripts, as it can help point out things such as a missed end-quote when I am
typing.
