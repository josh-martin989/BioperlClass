The following table descriptions correspond to my data model for a database for this question:

Table Name: gene
Field_Name	Datatype	Notes
gid	INT	primary key, combination of organism and gene because an organism has many genes and a gene can be found in many organisms
name	VARCHAR(255)	gene name
sequence	TEXT	Full gene sequence


Table Name: organism
Field_Name	Datatype	Notes
oid	INT	primary key, lookup table
latin_name	VARCHAR(255)


Table Name: rna
Field_Name	Datatype	Notes
transcript_id	INT	primary key
gid	INT	foreign key from 'gene' table, transcript has one gene it comes from, but gene can have many transcripts
start	INT	start position of ORF that produces this transcript in Full gene sequence from 'gene' table
stop	INT	end position of ORF in Full gene sequence


Table Name: expression
Field_Name	Datatype	Notes
eid	INT	primary key, combination of transcript_id from 'rna' and Tissue id because tissues express multiple transcripts and a transcript can be expressed in many tissues
elevel	INT	level of expression for this rna/tissue


Table Name: tissue
Field_Name	Datatype	Notes
tid	INT	primary key, lookup table
name	VARCHAR(255)	specific name of the tissue
